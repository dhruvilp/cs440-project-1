# cs440-project-1

In this project, we have implemented Forward A*, Backward A* and Adaptive A* path- planning in relation to video game technologies to observe their behaviors in several maze configurations. Python has been used as a primary language to write the code and to ”pygame” framework to generate the environment. We have used threads in this project to maintain the execution and implementation of algorithms.
### How to Use:
Options: 1=Forward A* ; 2=Backward A* ; 3=Adaptive A* 

### Run: `python3 main.py 1`
